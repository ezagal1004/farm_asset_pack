The code that is running in the\n * simulator can be edited by clicking on the file explorer to the\n * left and selecting \"test.ts\". Any code added to \"test.ts\" will\n * not be added to a project that imports this sprite pack as an\n * extension.\n *\n * If you don't wish to publish this project, you can use this project\n * as-is. Your sprites should show up in the sprite gallery. Make sure\n * you delete the code in \"test.ts\"!\n *\n *\n * To publish this project to GitHub:\n *   1. Rename this project to something descriptive\n *   2. Click the GitHub button in the bottom bar next to the save\n *      button (sign in to GitHub if prompted)\n *   3. Choose a name for your repository. This is the name that\n *      people will see when importing your project.\n *   4. Make sure \"public repository\" is selected in the dropdown\n *      if you want other people to be able to use your sprites\n *   5. Click \"go ahead\"\n *   6. If you are on a shared computer, make sure you sign out of\n *      GitHub!\n *\n *\n * To add a published project to an Arcade project:\n *   1. Inside the MakeCode editor, click \"Extensions\" under \"Advanced\"\n *      in the toolbox\n *   2. Inside the search box that appears, type your GitHub username\n *      followed by a \"/\" and the name of the repository. It should\n *      look something like this: username/repository\n *   3.
